<h2>Double Dream of Pearls</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
<ul>
<li>My game ups the challenge of the classic Breakout by making the player manage two "pearls."
<li>I also wanted to create a summery theme with the beach and ocean-related sprites and music.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
<ul>
<li>The game engine has to account for two physical bodies--the pearls--instead of just one. 
<li>This didn't mean just doubling all the places there was a ball. Some interactions affect both, others just one.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
<ul>
<li>Making the music and finding the sprites was fun. I felt I had the most stylistic control in these parts.
<li>Getting the two pearls to work was more difficult than I expected. There are still some issues--for example, they won't both spawn on the clam!
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
<ul>
<li>Music: I made the music myself in GarageBand.
<li>Clam sprite (recolored by me): <a href="http://pixelartmaker.com/art/e4316a2250d84ca">It's a clam</a></li>
<li>Pearl sprite: <a href="http://pixelartmaker.com/art/867e3a2c5290954">Pearl (reference sprite)</a></li>
<li>Ocean background: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/rVloVq5">The Ocean</a></li>
<li>The blocks come from the assets of the Phaser Example.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Which other game most closely resembles your game? If you are borrowing code from a Phaser Example, you must say so here. If you borrow code from elsewhere, you must say so here.
<ul>
<li>My game is an iteration on the classic game Breakout.
<li>I based mine off the Breakout Phaser example: <a href="https://phaser.io/examples/v2/games/breakout">Breakout</a></li>
<li>I also used a few lines of code from Stack Overflow user Javier Fernandes to loop the music: <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34210393/looping-audio-in-phaser">Looping audio in Phaser</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A one-sentence summary of your game.
<ul>
<li>Use both of your precious pearls to break all the blocks in this summer-breeze of a game!
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
State which input, randomness, genre, and play style you used in this prototype.
<ul>
<li>Input: Mouse input. Also works on touchscreens.
<li>Randomness: The motion of the pearls is slightly random, so they will rarely get stuck in some sort of pattern.
<li>Genre: Classic arcade game.
<li>Playstyle: Casual; short sessions; low skill necessary, but somewhat difficult to master.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
What game mechanic is this prototype evaluating?
<ul>
<li>Simulating and managing two arcade-physics bodies at once.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
What experience do you want players to have when playing your game?
<ul>
<li>Players should feel a mix of relaxation and happiness from the summer theme, mixed with the stress of making sure they don't lose any pearls.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
A paragraph describing the actions the player can perform, the system dynamics, and the core mechanic. Include a concise explanation of the prototypeâ€™s inputs and their expected effects (how to play). You can also describe game play that is not in the prototype. You may include mock-up images for parts of the game not in the prototype.
<li>First, the player clicks or taps to release the pearls. Then, the player moves the clam from side to side using a mouse or by sliding on a touchscreen. The player wants to make sure the pearls bounce off the clam when they are headed towards the bottom of the screen--or else, they will lose a life! When a pearl collides with a block, it will break it, and open up new directions for the pearls to bounce in. A player can rack up a lot of points by getting a pearl to bounce between two rows of blocks, hitting them all. To win the game, a player must break all of the blocks without losing all of their pearls.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
What player strategies do you expect will be effective at playing this game?
<ul>
<li>Make sure to keep track of the location of both pearls at all times!
<li>Bouncing the pearl between two rows will rack up lots of points.
<li>Try to space out the pearls so that you won't have to bounce both back at the same time.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A paragraph about the world your game is set in and who the characters are. What makes the game world and its occupants unique and interesting? Do the tokens represent something? If the game has a backstory, mention it here. If the game is abstract, then say so.
How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
<ul>
<li>The game is fairly abstract. The clam wants to keep its precious pearls from falling down into the depths of the ocean, so it has to keep bouncing them!
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
A single sentence that describes the demographic you're trying to reach.
<ul>
<li>The game is aimed towards fans of the beach, summer, and perhaps cute things.
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
How long does your game take to play?
<li>A game takes about 1-2 minutes. A very successful game might last a little longer.
</li>

</ul>
