<h2>Hunt for the Golden Eggs</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I manually created the design and structure of the tilemap and tile collisions.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
Each tile has custom-made collision boundaries.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned how to use tilemaps, but faced a lot of difficulties in setting it up. Particularly, I worked on the tile collisions
for a long time.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.

<li>Tile spritesheet by kenney.nl: <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-complete-pack-often-updated</a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The game code is based off of Starstruck from the Phaser examples.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Help the chicken collect all of its golden eggs!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, Deterministic, Collector, Platformer
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
This prototype is evaluating map & platforming design.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Players should feel the urge to collect all of the hen's golden eggs.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The player can walk and jump through the map, aiming to collect all of the golden eggs. The player controls the hen with the 
arrow keys, and uses the space key to jump. In attempting to collect all of the eggs, the player should traverse the 
entirety of the map (that is, a path through the map) In a future iteration, I would like to add additional levels
which begin after the player collects all of the eggs in a given level.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Don't fall in the water!
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
Ms. Hen woke up one morning to discover that her precious golden eggs have been blown away by a fierce wind. Now, she must
travel far and wide to get them all back before anyone else can lay their hands on them.    
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The game is for children or casual audiences.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
2-3 mins.
</li>
