<h2>CS 325: THE GAME</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
I created the music and specially selected the assets to replicate the experience of taking CS 325.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I created the custom boss condition, which also changes the background music. It also properly switches between the regular enemy and boss modes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
One thing I would have like to added was to make the boss move about the screen to make it more challenging than the normal enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Did you make your prototype assets from scratch? Did you borrow them? Cite your sources here.
